    #190 &amp; #148 - Bump to version 4.9.35, and add a date

commit 250ce1c6d01a662999d756ad7ae49edea0ffd30a
Author: Geoff McLane &lt;ubuntu _at_ geoffair _dot_ info&gt;

    Issue #190 &amp; #148 - Restore tidyReleaseDate() function.
    
    There was an idea to mark this function deprecated, such that if used the
    developer would see a warning. But this was never implemented in a cross
    platform way.
    
    So for now revert to circa Jan 2015 when Jim added a build date to the
    version.txt file. And now both LIBTIDY_VERSION and RELEASE_DATE macros are
    established in CMakeLists.txt, and picked up in version.h.
    
    The idea is the date will now march forward with the version number, side
    by side in version.txt. Although have left tidy.c only emitting the
    version on the --version command.
    
    After this function has been marked deprecated for several release periods,
    only then should consideration be given to potentially removing it.

    Issue #218 - bump version for this fix

commit 18880eab5551dff617d9a09712468cc275bfe87a

    Issue #218 - Do NOT allocate a 1 byte null String buffer.
    
    This is when setting a String config value through say tidyOptSetValue
    using say tidyOptSetValue(tdoc,id,&quot;&quot;).
    
    If the length of the new string is zero then do not allocate a 1 byte
    buffer, set it to 0, for the option. Any previous buffer has already been
    released.
    
    This means API functions like tidyOptSaveSink will not return erroneous
    null String values!

    Issue #210 - Add new warning for summary attr in table if HTML5.
    
    This new warning will only be seen if the document remains in HTML5 mode,
    where the summary attribute is obsolete. The W3C validator flags this as
    an error, and suggests 'Consider describing the structure of the table in
    a caption element or in a figure element containing the table; or simplify
    the structure of the table so that no description is needed'.
    
    At the same time this patch also restored the old warning if the document
    is HTML4--, if the table element lacks a summary attribute. This has been
    a tidy warning since the beginning of time, although the W3C validator
    does not presently flag this.
