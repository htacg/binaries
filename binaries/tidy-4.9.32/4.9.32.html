    Issue #212 - bump version for this additional change

commit 326f2414fd402f0c1113c90044a105ad38e3e9dc
Author: Geoff McLane &lt;ubuntu _at_ geoffair _dot_ info&gt;

    Issue #212 - Further fix to set MixedContent in some cases.
    
    In certain circumstances a leading space has to be preverved to allow it
    to be used to create a text space node to insert before this element to
    preserve the view in a browser.
    
    And added a note asking why is ParseTag called with a hardcoded
    IgnoreWhitespace when some effort above has set the mode variable to
    MixedContent in certain cases, but need to think about this 2nd change.
    
    Also added some MSVC Debug output when this leading text is used to insert
    such a created text node before the element just to be reminded of this
    special event.

    Add debug display of text modes.
    
    Note this ONLY effects a MSVC Debug build!

    Bump version for issue #217 fix

    Issue #217 - avoid len going negative, ever...

commit 0fb7ccdfc6ea4e066ec60cd5c931e17eaa71d856
Author: Geoff McLane &lt;ubuntu _at_ geoffair _dot_ info&gt;
Date:   Wed Jun 3 20:22:20 2015 +0200

    Add some mem alloc and free debug to chase Issue #217
    
    Such debug is OFF by default, and only added by defining DEBUG_MEMORY. And
    is only available for the Debug configuration compiled with MSVC, but this
    could be easily extended...

    Small fix in platform.h, just for windows (WIN32)
    
    Not sure how this has lasted so long, but I guess there are not too many
    users wanting to specifically use the static tidy library.
    
    Now it is possible to define TIDY_STATIC and the TIDY_EXPORT macro will
    just be 'external', suitable for linking with the static library, instead
    of adding the _imp_ MSVC __declspec( dllimport )...
    
    This fix does not effect other than the WIN32 platform build.

    bump to 4.9.30 adding build shared and static

commit efb8e37664250cf91780efe1764ddb0c161ae9f2

    Build both static and shared libraries.
    
    First many other projects do this, and it seems a good choice.
    
    Due mainly to windows where the static and shared libraries have the same
    name, appended an 's' to the static library.
    
    The tidy console app will use the static library, since to build the man
    page tidy may need to be run before the shared libraries are installed.
    And this makes the windows tidy exe a stand-alone app. No DLL install
    issue.
    
    This addresses issue #194, and possibly #190

    Issue #108 - merged indent-with-tabs branch into master.
    
    Thought there may be some comments on this but nothing for a week.
    So have merged to master hoping more people will test it, and any
    remaining issues resolved.
    
    Now it will be present from version 4.9.29 onwards.</pre>
